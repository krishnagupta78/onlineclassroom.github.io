          Essay on Kalinga War

According to the Megasthenes, the Greek historian at the court of Chandragupta Maurya, the ruler of Kalinga has a powerful army comprising infantry, cavalry and elephants. According to the rock edict 13, both side suffered losses, but people of Kalinga suffered a most. Although he won the war, Ashoka realized the futility of war. He was terrified by the bloodshed and suffering of the soldiers’ families. He vowed never to fight again. The war led to change of his heart and he decided to gave up everything and convert himself into a Buddhist. The war of Kalinga taught us about the cost of nonviolence, the values of life and love in the world. According to me it is one of most important chapter of human cycle. It teaches us to spread love and peace instead of hate and fight. The value of Kalinga war was so strong that it even lead to the heart change of Ashoka.
Historians were having a drastically different views regarding the reasons that compelled Ashoka the great to invade Kalinga. When Ashoka who was the son of the Mauryan emperor Bindusara and the grandson of Chandragupta Maurya who was the first Mauryan Emperor. He ascended the throne of Magadha in 273 BC. Ashoka always dreamed to follow the footsteps of his father and grandfather and set out to expand his empire to become a greatest king. Kalinga was a big part of Magadha Empire during the time of the Nandas. When the Nandas were defeated by Chandragupta Maurya, Kalinga became an independent state. While Chandragupta Maurya and Bindusara at initials wanted to re-conquer it but they could not succeed. It was Ashoka the great who came forward to conquer it again. Also, some historians revealed after certain point of time that Kalinga had already expanded its military and defence power and had huge material prosperity because of its trade relations with Java, Malay, and Ceylon, right from the time of Emperor Chandragupta to that of Ashoka the great. Emperor Ashoka could never neglect the great importance of Kalinga for the Mauryan Empire. The vast military power, wealth and strength of Kalinga were the central causes of jealousy and greed for the Magadha Empire and so, Ashoka wanted it passionately to re-establish the Magadh power and glory in this state. In the 12th year of Ashoka's reign, he sent a message to the ruler in chief of Kalinga to surrender peacefully his empire to the Mauryan. However, Kalingaraj or the king of Kalinga directly refused to give away his lordly power at Kalinga to the Mauryan Empire. Thus, followed a huge war between the two rulers in 261 B.C.
Kalinga war had a glorious impact on Ashoka as he realised that he had achieved nothing but a land without people. All he saw was crying widows and mourning mothers of dead. It is worth it understanding the reason as this war changes the course of Ashoka’s personal life and Bherighosa was replaced by Dhammaghosa. The war carried filled his heart with deep sorrow and remorse to him. He was shook to see the separation of people were dying of hundreds to of thousands and loss brought by Kalinga war. He abandoned the policy to war that is a physical occupation of any place and favour of cultural conquest. He adopted practical ways of consolidating his empire.
He started the following Dhamma on the name of his mother Dharma. Dhamma meant that everyone is equal and asked everyone to practice it too. He tried to spread the ideology of Buddhism at home and sends missionaries abroad. He asked the tribe people to follow dharma and to punish anyone violating rules he appointed Rajukas, this was fruitful in the long term as people gave up on fishing hunting. Ashoka used propaganda to enlarge his influence on areas. There were significant changes in state policy. It ended the policy of Magadhan imperialism. Asoka ended the age old policy of aggression and conquest of the Magadhan Kings. A new policy of Peace and non-violence began to be adopted in the realm of inter-state relation. This led to flourishing of a new dynasty where the blood-thirsty tyrant became a lover of mankind who preached non-violence.
